## Components of a .NET implementation



1. ## One or more runtimes
- examples: .NET Framework CLR, .NET 5 CLR

2. ## A class library
- examples: .NET Framework Base Class Library, .NET 5 Bass Class Library

3. ## Optionally--one or more application framweworks
- examples: ASP.NET, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

4. ## Optionally, development tools



*********** SDK vs. RUntime*************

- The software development kit (SDK) includes everything you need to both build and run .NET Core applications using command line tools and any editor (including Visual Studio);

- Whereas the runtime includes just the resources required to run existing .NET applications. 

- The runtime is included in the SDK

## .NET Standard ##

- A set of APIs that are implemented by the Base Class Library of a .NET
implementation

- The Bass Class Library (BCL) provides classes and types that are helpful in performing day to day operation
e.g. deaaling with string and primitive data types, database connection, IO operations


## CLR (Common Language Runtime)

- .NET privides a runtime environment called the common language runtime, that runs the code and provides services that make the dvlpmnt process easier

---- Some of the Services Provided are ---
1. Memory Management
2. JIT Compilation
3. Exception Handling Support

## Managed Code ## 

- Code whose execution is managed by a runtime
- the CLR is in charge of taking the managed code, compiling it into machine code, and then executing it. On top of that, runtime provides important services such as automatic memory managemen, security boundaries, type safety, etc

## Unmanaged Code ##
- Code that is developed outside .NET is unmanaged code
    - Code that isn;t mangaged by the CLR
    - Does not leverage CLR features such as memory management

- Executed by the help of wrapper classes

## Garbage Collection ##
- CLR provides automatic memory management of your heap memory
- When the garbage collector performs a collection, it checks for objects in the managed heap that are no longer being used by the application and performs the necessary operations to reclaim their memory

- Sometimes we use resources that are outside the scope of the CLR. We need to clean these up ourselves. 

- We use the dispose() method from the IDisposable Interface to cleanup these external resources
---Types that utilize these unmanaged resources inherit from the         IDisposable Interface

- You can also use blocks and statements for cleanup
